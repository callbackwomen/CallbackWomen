**Question:** Who can attend? **Answer:** You! People of all genders are welcome at CallbackWomen workshops. It's especially terrific when cis men attend as guest of an enthusistic participant who is another gender.

## Workshops

### "Proposing Your First Tech Conference Talk"

A three-part half-day workshop

**PART 1 (Talk)**
A presentation focused on why to become a tech conference speaker, qualifications, benefits & tradeoffs, and how to find and evalute CFPs for strategic fit.

**PART 2 (Q&A Session)**
An extensive and lengthy Q&A session. The workshop participants posed a deluge of great questions â€” not just about entering speaking but also how to deal with things that come after it. My favorite part of giving this talk & workshop is getting to learn what else what people need demystified. There's so much. When it comes to tech conference speaking, virtually everything aspect and step is a mystery to newcomers.

**PART 3 (Breakout Groups)**
When giving this [workshop at Girl Develop It Raleigh](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-RDU/events/225089443/), Conference organizer and speaker [Bridget Kromhut](https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout) and speaker [Yoko Harada](https://twitter.com/yokolet) generously volunteered to each mentor a breakout group. The three of us each helped particants brainstorm talk ideas and shape those into something concrete, exciting, and targeted.

*Every* participant had at least one idea that would be a compelling topic for conference program committees and audience to see. Even participants who initially said "I don't have anything that I could speak about" started to embrace what veteran speakers know: Yes, you do. Really. Everybody does. Communicating effectively about it is where the hard work is. 

It's a delight afterward to here from women announcing that they put in their first proposal immediately after the workshop. Score!


#### Be a Workshop Sponsor!

Expanding the workshop makes it possible to give attendees more individualized coaching on conference targeting and writing abstracts. These are crucial takeaways. **To sponsor a CallbackWomen workshop, ping via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/callbackwomen) or [email](callbackwomen@gmail.com).**
