## The Quick Version

Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender and gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

No weapons of any kind, alcohol, or drugs are allowed at venues.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender and gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

No weapons of any kind, alcohol, or drugs are allowed at venues.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified as they'll be wearing staff name badges. Written reports can be made anonymously at [https://callbackwomen.wufoo.com/forms/code-of-conduct-report/](https://callbackwomen.wufoo.com/forms/code-of-conduct-report/)

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
