## Conferences

### Why Attend

* Peers. Do you crave having more? Feel isolated from others who do what you do? Conferences connect people. You carry that sense of connectedness back home with you.
* Sense of connection to something bigger. Pride in being part of that community.
* i18n. Random chats w/devs from elsewhere can lead to unexpected insights re internationalization problems.
* Have/hear different discussions than the same predictable stuff at the office.

### Why Speak

* "I would really love to discuss that w/you more..." Surprising opportunities  come out of those discussions.
* People who you admire introduce themselves to you, recognize you as their peer, and become fans of your work too!  (Including “well-known” people you thought would never talk to you!) 
* Challenge. Nudge yourself to learn, then share, something new because you've proposed to talk about it.
* Thought leadership. Speaking on a topic can earn you the reputation as someone whose thoughts on it matter.
* Facilitates introverts. Speakers get introduced to amazing people. Insight-filled conversations!
* Conversation. Opportunity to have interesting conversations that you can't have anywhere else.
* Network. Speakers get to expand their networks organically, and across a range of locations & topics.
* Free ticket!
