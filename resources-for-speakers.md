## Conferences

### Why Attend

+ **Peers**. Do you crave having more? Feel isolated from others who do what you do? Conferences connect people. You carry that sense of connectedness back home with you.
+ **Sense of connection to something bigger**. Pride in being part of that community.
+ **Random chats w/devs from elsewhere**. That leads to unexpected insights re internationalization probs
+ **Have/hear different discussions** than the same predictable stuff at the office.

### Why Speak

"I would really love to discuss that w/you more..." Surprising opportunities come out of those discussions.

People who you admire introduce themselves to you, recognize you as their peer, and become fans of your work too!  (Including “well-known” people you thought would never talk to you!) 

Challenge. Nudge self to learn, then share, something new b/c you've proposed to talk abt it.

Thought leadership. Speaking abt a topic can earn rep as someone whose thoughts on it matter.

Facilitates introverts. Speakers get introduced to amazing ppl. Insight-filled conversations!

Conversation. Opportunity to have interesting conversations that you can't have anywhere else

Network. Speakers get to expand network organically, and across range of locations & topics.

Sometimes, you get a free ticket to a conference.

The audience is there for the same reason you are: passion about the work. They respect talks that explore & advance that passion.
