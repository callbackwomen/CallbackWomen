## Note {#underrepresented}

CallbackWomen is about every person whose gender is underrepresented in tech. `Women` encompasses all women, including transgender women and cis women. `Gender non-binary` encompasses people who are genderqueer, gender non-conforming, and many others [^1]. `Transgender men` are men.

Being non-consensually positioned in a context called `*Women` implictly misgenders a gender non-binary person or a trans man. CallbackWomen enthusiastically promotes the work of speakers who are gender non-binary and speakers who are trans men, *if the speaker has given personal consent to*.
