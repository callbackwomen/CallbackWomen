## Mission

The mission of [CallbackWomen](http://twitter.com/callbackwomen) is to radically expand gender diversity at the podium of professional programmers' conferences.

CallbackWomen **remakes norms**. Since 2013, CallbackWomen's work of advocacy, education, support, and promotion has been an influential change agent.


## What We Do

CallbackWomen focus is on serving organizers and speakers. The testimonials page shares individual stories of its impact, from the perspectives of [a long-time conference organizer](personal-stories.html) and [speakers](personal-stories.html#speakers).

### Organizers

* Providing them an audience of 4,400 followers eager to learn about their Calls for Proposals (CFPs) and diversity initiatives
* Introducing them to resources & experts
* Educating them about how caregiving responsibilies, pay gap, safety, intersectionality, etc constrain marginalized people's participation
* Advocating for innovative ways to increase diversity among attendees
* Pushing back on assumptions about gender, experience, and qualifications
* Displaying how their peers communicate & enforce codes of conduct
* Amplifing their fellow conference organizers' diversity and diversity commitments, models, and successes
* Supporting adoption of codes of conduct (CoCs), and showing how their peers are handling CoC violations
* Educating them about the [Code of Conduct Pledge](http://twitter.com/cocpledge)'s impact on sponsorship, ticket sales, volunteerism, and speaker participation
* Normalizing expectations of gender diversity at the podium
* Exposing them to highly qualified speakers who are women, as well as (*upon individuals' permission*) genderqueer & gender non-conforming


### Speakers

* Validating self-promotion of talks & ideas
* Drawing attention to rave reviews

## Note

`Women` encompasses all women, including cis and transgender.

`Gender non-binary` encompasses people who are genderqueer, gender non-conforming, and others [^1]. **CallbackWomen is absolutely intended to promote  gender non-binary speakers.** Being non-consensually positioned in a context called `*Women` implictly misgenders that person. The project's policy is to promote talks of gender non-binary people *who have given personal consent* to doing that.
